            Aayush Wellness Limited (BSE Listed), a diversified health and wellness company, today announced a strategic collaboration with Healthrashi Nextgen India Ltd, under its recently launched ₹50 Million Startup Accelerator Program. This partnership marks Aayush Wellness’s expansion into India’s rapidly growing $370 Billion HEALTHCARE. Preventive healthcare is emerging as one of the fastest-growing segments of India’s USD 1.3 trillion healthcare and wellness industry, driven by lifestyle disorders, rising health awareness, and government initiatives encouraging early detection and wellness adoption. According to NITI Aayog, nearly 65 % of hospital infrastructure is concentrated in urban India, leaving vast semi-urban and rural populations underserved. This presents a massive opportunity for scalable, technology-enabled solutions.

            “This collaboration is a strategic leap forward, perfectly aligning with our mission to build a technology-driven wellness ecosystem. By integrating these scalable healthcare innovations, we are poised to unlock meaningful value for our investors and, most importantly, deliver affordable preventive care to millions of people who need it most.” Naveena Kumar Managing Director of Aayush Wellness MARKET.
